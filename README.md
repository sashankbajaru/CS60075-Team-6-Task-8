This repository contains the code created for SemEval-2021 Task-8 as a part of CS60075(NLP) course.
Google colab is recommended for executing the notebook provided.

Please follow the instructions given in the notebook for executing the code. Note that one has to execute subtask-3 twice (once for entity spans and once for property spans) as given in the instructions.

Due to the glitch in Codalab, we couldn't submit our files to the leaderboard on time. Below is our final result on the leaderboard (f1-overlap of 0.24). Please note that the score mentioned in the report is outdated.
