Please follow the instructions given in the notebook for executing the code. Note that one has to execute subtask-3 twice (once for entity spans and once for property spans) as given in the instructions.

Due to the glitch in Codalab, we couldn't submit our files to the leaderboard on time. Below is our final result on the leaderboard (f1-overlap of 0.24)
